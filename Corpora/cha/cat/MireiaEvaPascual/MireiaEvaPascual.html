<h3>Project Description</h3>

This corpus contains data that were videotaped by Mireia Llinàs-Grau and
transcribed in CHAT format by several research assistants (Susanna Aspa,
Susagna Tubau, Elisabet Pladevall and Maria Rosa Garrido) of the
Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). It consists of the transcripts
of three typically developing Catalan children, two sisters (Mireia and
Eva) and a brother (Pascual). Mireia was born on November 10, 1993, Eva
on  November 21, 1995 and Pascual on  July 25, 2000. They are the
researcher's three children. They were born and live in Barcelona and
the language spoken at home is Catalan, although the children are also 
exposed to Spanish (TV, cinema, friends) and speak it. Both parents have
university education. The recordings were collected at the children's
home in natural and daily activities such as taking a bath, having
lunch, playing with toys or looking at book pictures.
