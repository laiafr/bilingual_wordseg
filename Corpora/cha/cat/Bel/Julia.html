<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This corpus contains data that were videotaped and transcribed in CHAT format by Aurora Bel, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). It consists of transcripts of a typically developing Catalan girl, Júlia, who is the first child of the researcher and was born on 21st of September 1990. Júlia’s parents live in Barcelona and the language spoken at home is Catalan although the environmental languages in Barcelona are both Catalan and Spanish. Both parents have university education. 

<p>The recordings were collected in Júlia’s home in natural and daily activities such as taking a bath, having lunch, playing with toys, looking at book pictures, etc. During a first period the child was recorded every two weeks for 30-45 minutes and during a second period she was recorded monthly. The samples cover a period that goes from the onset of first words to 2;6 years of age. The utterances, both from the child and the adults, were orthographically transcribed according to CHAT conventions without English glosses. The transcriptions were verified by a second transcriber. The corpus includes a total of 17 files (see Table 1). Laia Cutillas, a research assistant at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, arranged the final version of the transcripts and normalized the files for CLAN programs.
