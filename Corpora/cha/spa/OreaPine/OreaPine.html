<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>The collection of the Aguado-Orea and Pine corpus was funded by the
University of Nottingham between October 2000 and September 2003, as
part of the research carried out by Javier Aguado-Orea towards his PhD,
supervised by Julian Pine. The corpus consists of naturalistic data
recorded by children’s parents without the presence of an investigator.
Sessions were video-recorded in the home using a digital camcorder with
a small tripod. Informants gave informed consent for the use of their
data. The parents were given some basic recording guidelines (e.g. avoid
noisy backgrounds and try to record ‘varied’ and ‘interactive’
situations), but were told that the main aim of the study was to collect
as large and as ‘natural’ a sample of their child’s spontaneous speech
as possible. Juan and Lucía’s parents typically recorded 2 or 3
sessions per week, with each session lasting between 20 and 40 minutes
(M = 29 minutes for Juan and M = 29 minutes for Lucía). The resulting
corpora included 1930 minutes for Juan (61 minutes per week on average)
and 1387 minutes for Lucía (68 minutes per week on average).

<p>Children’s imitations and self-repetitions were labelled, as were
utterances containing unclear or unintelligible segments. Songs, stories
and routines were also labelled. Both Juan and Lucía were first-born
children, who had lived in the Madrid area of Spain since birth. Juan
was 1;10.21 and Lucía was 2;2.25 when the recordings began. The
children’s parents were middle class professionals. The only language
used by the parents was Spanish. Lucía was taught some English words at
nursery, mainly colour names.
