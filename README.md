# Modeling Bilingual Word Segmentation 

This project aims to model balanced bilinguals and monolinguals of 3 different languages, with language switching happening every other sentence, or every 100 sentences.  

We test the performance of different algorithms on word segmentation that represent different coginitve strategies that infants could be brining into the word segmentation task.

This repository contains the collected corpora from English, Catalan and Spanish which are also freely available in CHILDES https://childes.talkbank.org As well as all the steps to process the data wich are descrived in the recipes of each language.
